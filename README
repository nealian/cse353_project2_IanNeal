Feature                                                 Status/Description
-------                                                 -------
Load input file                                         complete
Parse input file                                        complete
Generate token                                          complete
Generate frame                                          complete
Node runs as an autonomous thread                       complete
All nodes terminate                                     can't tell; hasn't run to completion
follow the command line to execute the program          complete
randomly accept a frame                                 complete
extract all fields from a frame                         can't tell; hasn't run to completion (seems to not be passing tokens... Bah)
switch between listen and transmit states               incomplete; seems to not be passing tokens?
pass the tokens and frames to next neighbor             incomplete; can't tell what's wrong
print to the output with the correct format             can't tell; hasn't gotten to output anything
documentation                                           partly missing; much of the code is self-explanatory, much is commented
executable files                                        complete
monitor detects lost token                              incomplete (mostly missing)
monitor cleans up garbled frames                        missing
monitor detects orphaned frames                         complete (though can't tell if it's working)

optional extra credit work:
  binary frame                                          complete; can't quite tell if it's working
  thread synchronization                                complete; can't tell if it's working


Make instructions:
Use provided makefile (that is, simply run `make`) on a TCC Linux machine

Known bugs:
Doesn't... transmit? Doesn't receive properly? I can't tell.

Token holding time:
665 byes; this is five AVERAGE frames (half-sized DATA), which is still more than one max-sized frame.

Garbled frame simulation:
Unfortunately, unimplemented.
